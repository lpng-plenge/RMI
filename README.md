In this project we will solve nxn square matrices where we will see the difference in the execution of the three types of programming (Parallel Concurrent and Sequential Matrix).
1.-Open the terminal 
2.-Compile all the java files using the command javac *.java.
3.-In the same terminal run ChatServer and give it a group name, i.e.: 'Paralelo' (this name will give you a private session in the same network that the server is running).
4.-In another terminal or on another PC run ConfiguracionUsuario, and put the name of your host. Note: In the text boxes put the same data of the IP and the name of the group of the terminal of the server. 
5.-If all goes well, you have to search for users for parallel matrix troubleshooting. This can be done by going to the top of the Edit window and clicking on the chat. There we will see the users connected in our server and we can also chat with them.
6.- We proceed to select the connected users and then we can solve the parallel matrix.
Feel free to explore all the functions to solve addition and multiplication of matrices in sequential, concurrent and parallel code.
